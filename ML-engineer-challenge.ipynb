    "## Background:\n",
    "You are provided with a boilerplate Python notebook that interacts with a pull request (PR) reviewer system using a Large Language Model (LLM). This system is designed to review code by identifying potential issues in the changes made in a PR. The initial setup involves parsing code from the repository, storing code snippets in a vector database (using ChromaDB), and querying this database to provide contextually relevant code examples for LLM-based code review. The reviews are done file-by-file with prompts structured to guide LLM in generating constructive feedback in a specific JSON format.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Task Overview:\n",
    "Your challenge is to conceptualize and implement enhancements in three key areas of the existing PR reviewer system:\n",
    "1. **Splitting files into chunks**\n",
    "2. **Retriever query generation system**\n",
    "3. **LLM review prompt structure**\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The challenge focuses on three critical areas requiring innovation and enhancement:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Splitting Files into Chunks**: You have to develop a sophisticated method for dividing repository code into meaningfully sized chunks or propose an entirely new approach for managing code snippets. The goal is to enhance logical or functional coherence within the chunks without losing efficiency.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Retriever Query Generator System**: You have to refine the systemâ€™s approach to generating queries for retrieving relevant documents from a vector database. You should aim to improve the precision and relevance of document retrieval and might want to explore advanced query generation strategies and incorporating richer contextual information.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **LLM Review Prompt Revamping**: Currently, the system reviews code on a per-file basis. You are encouraged to explore alternative methodologies, such as reviewing entire PRs in a holistic manner or employing a sophisticated LLM agent system for more effective and context-aware reviews.\n",
    "\n",
    "**You may choose to work on just one or any number of the above points.**"

    "## Introduction to Pre-made Tools\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to streamline the process of interacting with and analyzing repository files for our PR reviewer system, we've developed a suite of pre-made tools. These utilities are designed to handle various aspects of file manipulation, diff extraction, and repository management seamlessly. Below is an overview of each tool and its primary purpose.\n",
    "\n",
    "### LocalFile\n",
    "\n",
    "The `LocalFile` class acts as a refined interface for file interaction, offering a simplified way to access a file's contents along with pertinent metadata. It's an enhanced representation that abstracts away the complexities of raw file handling, making file operations more intuitive and less error-prone.\n",
    "\n",
    "### DiffRepresentation\n",
    "\n",
    "Dealing with diffs can be intricate, given their crucial role in identifying changes between file versions. The `DiffRepresentation` class simplifies this task by providing methods to extract and analyze diff metadata effectively. It specifically aids in parsing edit locations within a file, such as the line numbers of changed sections and the position of the [diff hunk header](https://stackoverflow.com/q/28111035), which marks the start of a set of differences in file content. This specialized tool ensures that diffs are handled accurately, facilitating a deeper analysis of code changes.\n",
    "\n",
    "### GithubUtils\n",
    "\n",
    "The `GithubUtils` class encapsulates functionality for fetching information and files from a specific GitHub repository and its associated PRs. It leverages the PyGithub library to abstract away the intricacies of API communication, offering a more user-friendly interface for retrieving the data needed for review analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "### LocalRepository\n",
    "\n",
    "To further mitigate the limitations posed by GitHub's rate limiting and to enhance the efficiency of repository analysis, the `LocalRepository` class provides a mechanism to mirror a GitHub repository locally.\n"

      "1. **Invalid task type handling**: The code allows for specific task types but does not provide validation for unsupported types.\n",
      "2. **Exception Handling in ThreadPoolExecutor**: Tasks submitted to the executor should have their exceptions handled to avoid the entire process failing due to individual task exceptions.\n",
      "3. **Potential Infinite Loop**: The while loop in `_prepare_and_validate_batches` could become infinite if exceptions aren't handled correctly or if `min_batch_size` doesn't update properly.\n",
      "4. **Token Estimation Documentation**: The method used for token count estimation is conservative and may not be accurate, which should be documented or reconsidered.\n",
      "5. **Thread Safety**: Shared state is being accessed and modified by potentially multiple threads without proper synchronization, posing a risk of race conditions.\n",
      "6. **Redundant Check**: The check for an empty text list is duplicated in two methods, which is not necessary and makes the code less clean.\n",
      "7. **Retry Logic Exception Handling**: The retry logic does not account for exceptions outside the predefined list, which could result in unhandled exceptions.\n",
      "8. **ThreadPoolExecutor Shutdown**: The executor is initialized but there is no clear mechanism for shutting it down, which could result in resource leaks.\n",
